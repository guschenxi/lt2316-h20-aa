# LT2316 H20 Assignment A1

Name: Xi Chen

I'm sorry that I haven't finished the whole assignment. There are still also some bugs in those part I have finished It seems that I have a lot to catch up. I'm not sure if I have missed a lot which is taught in the new courses of the new Language Technology Program, because I felt that a lot of things sounds unfamiliar, and probably not mentioned in the old Language Technology Programe. I think the introduction of the assignment sounds too simple and I couldn't understand everything, and I didn't find them in lectures or the book. However, I'm working as harder as I can to catch up. I totally understand if I can't get any points or fail in the assignments.
